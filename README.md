# FRAUD-DETECTION:
The system detects whether a particular transaction is a fraud or not. I have compared various ML algorithms like KNN,XGBoost ,Random forest ,Decision Tree Classifier,etc. The best accuracy among the following was of Decision Tree Classifier. I have learnt about different algorithms, application, etc. Aim to create a working model that can detect frauds in real time.
